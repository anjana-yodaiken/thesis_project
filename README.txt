In order to use the code the user needs to enter an array and change the values of two variables. 
The user should enter an array that corresponds to the pattern they want to make. 
The array of their choosing should be entered under the myPattern array ensuring the first line indicates the initial state of the pen click mechanisms 
(i.e. 1 is extended and 0 is retracted). 
It is assumed that all pen click mechanisms begin in their retracted state so it is preferrable to make the first and last lines a line of 0's. 
The user then needs to change the rowNum and colNum variables to the correct numbers in relation to the number of rows and columns in their pattern.
